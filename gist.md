# Title (replace with your title)

A Regular Expression is a special sequence of characters that help a user match or find strings (or sets of strings), using a special syntax. It is one of the most powerful concept used for pattern matching within strings. Hence, it is very important to know various Special Characters, Quantifiers, and Anchors that form part of regular expressions. Through this small post, I intend to discuss some of these with reference to Perl.

## Summary

Briefly summarize the regex you will be describing and what you will explain. Include a code snippet of the regex. Replace this text with your summary.

## Regex Components

### Anchors

These characters give details about the location within a particular string a user is trying to search. It helps in searching within lines. Usually, for finding character A in a string, you can use the following characters to find a match within a line:

A$: Helps in matching at the end of a line.
^A: Helps in matching at the beginning of a line.

### Quantifiers
Quantifiers specify how many times a pattern should be repeated. For example, the "*" quantifier matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding character, while the "+" quantifier matches one or more occurrences. Sample code snippet: The following regex will match any string that contains one or more digits:

/\d+/

### OR Operator

The "|" character is used as the OR operator in regular expressions, allowing you to match one of several alternatives. Sample code snippet: The following regex will match either "apple" or "orange":

/apple|orange/

### Character Classes

Character sets help you define parameters for the type of text you want to search. For instance, you can use [0-9] to search for numerical ranges. Interestingly, regex allows programmers to find letter ranges or support alternate spellings. For example, so[ml]e matches both some and sole. Some commonly used character sets are:

[a-z]: Helps in matching lowercase letters from a to z.
[A-Z]: Helps in matching uppercase letters from A to Z.
[0-9]: Helps match a range of numbers from 0 to 9.
[.]: Helps match any character, except line break characters.

### Flags

Flags are used to modify the behavior of a regular expression, such as making it case-insensitive or allowing it to match across multiple lines. Sample code snippet: The following regex will match any string that contains the word "hello", regardless of case:

/hello/i
